# About Fidenza
The Fidenza project is the brainchild of Tyler Hobbs. It is created from an auto generative model. This was developed on Art Blocks which now has become the most popular platform for minting Ethereum based generative art as NFTs.

# Order of Analysis
1. The analysis starts off with finding the highest priced NFT
2. Then all the previous sales for the highest priced NFT are found out
3. After that the resold count was calculated for NFTs in the fidenza projects and were ordered in a descending order
4. The final step was to find the secondary sales of each NFT with the commission that the creator got for each secondary sale
